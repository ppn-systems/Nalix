## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately through **GitHub Security Advisories** — use the **Security** tab in the [repository header](https://github.com/ppn-systems/Nalix/security) to create a private advisory.

For more information about private vulnerability reporting, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

## Security Best Practices

When using Nalix packages in production:

- Always use the **latest version** of each `Nalix.*` NuGet package.
- Do **not** disable integrity checks or modify package binaries.
- Validate all inputs and enforce encryption when using networking or cryptographic APIs.
- Review the [official documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) for recommended security configurations.
