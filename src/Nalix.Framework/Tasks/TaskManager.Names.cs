/// <para>
/// Conventions:
/// - Groups use path-style segments with '/' separators, because they often describe hierarchy.
/// - Workers and recurring jobs use dot-style segments with '.' separators, because they read like identifiers.
/// - All names are normalized to lowercase-safe tokens before they are concatenated.

/// <remarks>
/// This is a general-purpose library. Specific domains (TCP, limiter, etc.)
/// should build on top of these helpers rather than hardcoding names here.
